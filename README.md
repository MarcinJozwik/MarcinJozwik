👋 Hi! I'm **Marcin Jóźwik**. 

✍️ **About me:** I'm a Game Designer and Gameplay Programmer with over 6 years experience in creating video games and with a history of 30+ game projects, prototypes and development tools.

I see the world through the lens of games and I'm fascinated by the interdependencies of all the creative endeavors.

⚙️ **Repos:** My public repositories here mostly contain Unity tools I've developed to speed up my prototyping process. Feel free to take a look around. Maybe you will find something for you :)
